<h1>What you should know...</h1>

<h2 class="text-secondary">...about the airport</h2>
<p><strong>Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport</strong> is the main international airport of Hungary, located in the southeastern part of Budapest, currently serving 144 cities with 45 airlines and charters.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Terminals</h4>
<p>You can find two passenger terminals, but in general, passenger aircrafts are handled at Terminal 2, while cargo planes have their own, newly-built apron, called Cargo City.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Runway configurations</h4>
<p>There are two parallel runways (13R/31L and 13L/31R), and the configuration is made in a way that reduces taxi times:</p>
<ul>
    <li>in case of runway direction 13, RWY 13R and 13L are used for take-off, depending on the terminal the plane departs from, and RWY 13R is used for landing.</li>
    <li>in the opposite direction, RWY 31L is the preferred runway for take-off, and both runways can be used for landing, again, depending on the terminal the aircraft is arriving at.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="text-secondary mt-4">...about the event</h2>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Where and when to connect?</h4>
<p>When booking, you will notice that each inbound and outbound flight is assigned to a gate or stand. It is mandatory to use these assigned positions, otherwise, if you depart from Budapest, the ATC will ask you to reconnect at the correct place. In case of departures, you can connect at the stand or gate 30 minutes before your EOBT, and the arrivals may use their assigned gate or stand up to 10 minutes after the indicated on-block time.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Scenery</h4>
<p>It is highly recommended to have the up-to-date scenery of the airport, especially if you plan to fly cargo planes as their assigned stands are found in the Cargo City which is not included in the default scenery. For MSFS and Prepar3D we recommend using the <a href="https://lhsimulations.com/" target="_blank">LHSimulations</a> Budapest scenery. In case of the default scenery, please check the stands on the charts.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Charts</h4>
<p>Come prepared: do not forget to consult the appropriate charts prior to your flight and have them onboard, as you might need to enter a holding or execute a missed approach. Find the charts <a href="https://ais.hungarocontrol.hu/aip/2024-09-05/2024-09-05-AIRAC/html/eAIP/LH-AD-2.LHBP-en-HU.html#AD2LHBP0706130925027304" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Turnaround flights</h4>
<p>You will find two types of turnaround flights: those that turn at Budapest and fly back to the same airport as they arrived from, and those turning back to Budapest at the destination. You can choose to book both parts of a given sector, or just fly one leg, but keep in mind that in case of a Budapest turnaround, the departing aircraft will connect at the same gate or stand where the plane from the previous leg arrived.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Which plane to fly</h4>
<p>As for the planes, if you do not have the same type as indicated at the flight (e.g. Airbus A321 neo; Boeing 738 MAX), it is allowed to choose another within the category or family. If you are unsure about the aircraft type for a specific flight, please refer to the "Flight Briefing" section, which provides a list of approved substitutes. Additionally, for flights operated under wet lease by another airline, this information will be included in the briefing when applicable.</p>
