<h2>About the airport</h2>

<p><strong>Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport</strong> (Hungarian: Budapest Liszt Ferenc Nemzetk&ouml;zi Rep&uuml;l≈ët&eacute;r) (IATA: <strong>BUD</strong>, ICAO: <strong>LHBP</strong>), formerly known as Budapest Ferihegy International Airport and still commonly called just Ferihegy, is the international airport serving the Hungarian capital city of Budapest, and by far the largest of the country&#39;s four commercial airports. The airport is located 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) southeast of the center of Budapest (bordering Pest county) and was renamed in 2011 in honour of the most famous Hungarian composer Franz Liszt (Liszt Ferenc, in Hungarian) on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of his birth.</p>

<p>It offers international connections primarily within Europe, but also to Africa, to the Middle East, to North America and to the Far East. In 2017, the airport handled 13.1 million passengers. The airport serves as a hub for Wizz Air and as a base for Ryanair. In 2012 it experienced a significant drop in aircraft movements and handled cargo, primarily due to the collapse of Mal&eacute;v Hungarian Airlines earlier in the year, hence losing a large portion of connecting passengers. It had been the hub for Mal&eacute;v until the airline&#39;s bankruptcy on 3 February 2012.</p>
